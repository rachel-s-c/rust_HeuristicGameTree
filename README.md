# rust_HeuristicGameTree
HeuristicGameTree trait which provides an interface for various games to implement an AI opponent. Utilizes the minimax algorithm to predict moves (Negative Heuristic: Human Player vs Positive Heuristic: AI). Three games(Tic-Tac-Toe, Connect4, or Checkers) have been designed to confirm the generality of this HeuristicGame trait.  

# Use Cases
- Heuristics: important for optimization problems
- Games: Creating games that have single AI opponent. Minimax is a common strategy: it is a kind of backtracking algorithm that is used in decision making and game theory to find the optimal move for a player. Examples of applicable games: Tic-tac-toe, Checkers, Connect4, Mancala, and many more.
